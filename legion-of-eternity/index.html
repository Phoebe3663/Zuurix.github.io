<a>About the game</a>
</comments>

<p>Legion of Eternity is a singleplayer-focused story-driven card game that merges science fiction and cosmic horror to tell an epic, dark story.</p>
	
<i><p>We did something horrible. A mistake.
I cannot tell what we did. I can only try to describe what happened after.
First, it was the 26th century. Then it was the 26th century again. And again. And again.
Until it wasn't anymore, and we became what we weren't, adapted to the new, complex existence.
</p>

<p>We are being punished.
The reality has turned into a nightmare. It's full of monsters, errors, traps.
It's eroding our sanity.</p>

<p>Some of us think that we deserve it, that we should stop resisting.
Some of us can't think anymore, at least not in a way that I could describe.
</p>
	
<p>I think we should keep fighting.</p>
	
<p>The Protectorate with their spaceships, soldiers, and weapons of mass destruction have the right idea.
Annihilate monsters, try to simulate social connections, try to remember who we were, cling to what made us human.</p>

<p>But it's not enough, the nightmare always wins.
The reality will keep making horrors greater than our strength. It's proportional to our resistance.</p>

<p>I need to find a solution while I still can.</p>

<p>I remember something about what I did.
There is something that lurks beyond all of the complexities.</p>	

<p>I have created you to find old machines and arrays.
To do one last thing before we become infinite.
</p>
	
<p>They have to know.</p></i>
