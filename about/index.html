	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>'Ello! I am Ivar, also known as indie game developer Zuurix.</p>
	<p>I am officially making games since 2013, but pretended to be game developer ever since I started using computer.</p>
	<p>How does one pretend to be game developer? It's simple: Open MS paint and draw inventory screens, enemies, quest logs...</p>
	<p>I used to do it for hours every day, until I have decided that it's time to stop faking and start making real games.</p>
	<p>Years have passed and now I proudly call myself game developer.</p>
