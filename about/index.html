<h1>About</h1>

<p>'Ello! I am Ivar, also known as an independent game developer Zuurix.
<p>I am 21 years old and I am from Lithuania, which explains all the grammar errors =]

<p>Ever since I have discovered the awesomeness that is computer games, I wanted to make my own.
<p>Before I started developing games, I used to make drawings in MS Paint - quest logs, items, areas, monsters and other elements of a fictional game, that I pretended to be making.

<p>After spending too much time doing that, I have realized that I need to start making real games, so I learned a bit of programming and began making games with GameMaker: Studio.

<p>I make big games with complexity, customization, and procedural generation.

<p>Usually, I work alone on my games because I'm not a team guy and that means that I have to do almost everything myself.

<p>I love playing RPG's, CCG's and tower defense games, reading fantasy books, talking with people who play my games and listening to EDM or music by Two Steps From Hell.

<p>Oh, and sometimes I use 'Ello instead of Hello. Strange habit, I know.
