<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hello!

I am Ivar, also known as an independent game developer Zuurix.

Making games is everything to me and my ultimate goal is to become one of the best indie game developers in the world.

Video games have always excited me, I remember pretending to be a game developer ever since I got access to a computer.
I used MS Paint to make interfaces for the games I pretended to be making.

In 2012 my favorite game RuneScape have gone through heavy changes that made it unplayable for me.
The fall of RuneScape has left a huge void in my life and because I was unable to find a replacement for that game, I decided to start making my own games.

I learned programming basics with help of online courses and in September 2013 started making games with GameMaker: Studio.

In May 2016 I have released my first game on Steam.

I am planning to release more games in 2018, 2019, and 2020.

I have some programming and design experience, I can create a full game with GameMaker: Studio.

The only things that I truly can't do are sounds and music.

When I don't make games, I play games.
I'm also sci-fi/fantasy book and movie enthusiast.
