<p>I am Zuurix, an indie game developer from Lithuania.</p>
	
<p>I enjoy making all sorts of games, but currently I'm narrowing focus to role-playing, shooter, and card games.</p>
	
<p>In September 2013 I have completed several online JavaScript lessons, downloaded GameMaker engine and month later I had my first real game done.</p>

<p>After that I've been making games nonstop.</p>
	
<p>My first serious commercial game – Sector Six – was released on May 2016 as a Steam Early Access title.</p>
<p>In September 2018 it has left Early Access and currently, Sector Six is my most successful game.</p>
	
<p>In July 2021 I have created Small Moons game studio for myself, and since then I am mostly operating under that name.</p>

<p>Right now I am working on Magic of Spring, a card adventure game. There are big releases in the plans for 2022 and 2023!</p>
