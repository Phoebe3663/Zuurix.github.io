	<h1>About</h1>
	
	<p>'Ello! I am Ivar, also known as an independent game developer Zuurix. I am 21 years old and I am from Lithuania, which explains all the grammar errors.</p>
	<p>I am officially making games since 2013, but I pretended to be game developer ever since I started using a computer. How does one pretend to be a game developer? It's simple: Open MS Paint and draw inventory screens, enemies, quest logs... I used to do it for hours every day until I have decided that it's time to stop faking and start making real games. Years have passed and now I proudly call myself game developer.</p>
	<p>I have made four big games so far. Usually, I work alone on my games because I'm not a team guy. My goal is to make innovative games and I hope that in future my games will be well known. My biggest strength is my unwavering motivation. I never give up.</p>
	<p>I love role-playing, tower defense and collectible card games, fantasy books, spaceships, magic, cats, Two Steps From Hell music and talking with my players.</p>
	<p>I hate old stuff, anime, unoriginality and everything that has something to do with beetroots.</p>
	<p>Oh, and sometimes I use 'Ello instead of Hello. Strange habit, I know.</p>
