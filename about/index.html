<h1>About</h1>

<p>I am Aivaras Klimas, also known as an independent game developer Zuurix. Making games is everything to me.</a>

<p>Video games have always excited me, I remember pretending to be a game developer ever since I got access to a computer.
I used to create interface sprites and other assets with MS Paint for fictional games.</p>

<p>In 2012 my favorite game RuneScape have gone through heavy changes that made it unplayable for me.
Because I was unable to find a replacement for that game, I decided to stop pretending and start making real games.</p>

<p>I learned programming basics with help of online courses and in September 2013 started making games with GameMaker: Studio.</p>

<p>My first serious commercial game – Sector Six – was released on May 2016 as a Steam Early Access title.</p>
<p>In September 2018 it has left Early Access and currently, Sector Six is my biggest game.</p>

<p>I am planning to release more games in 2019 and 2020.</p>

<p>My strengths are coding and design. I can make decent graphics as well.</p>
<p>I would like to become better at writing and try making music at some point, just to see if I can do it.</a>

<p>When I don't make games, I play games, watch TV shows or YouTube, sometimes read books.
I'm a huge fan of everything sci-fi/fantasy.</p>
