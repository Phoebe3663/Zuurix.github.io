	<h1>Home</h1>
	<p>'Ello! I am Ivar, also known as indie game developer Zuurix.</p>
	<p>I am officially making games since 2013, but pretended to be game developer ever since I started using computer.</p>
	<p>How does one pretend to be game developer? It's simple: Open MS Paint and make game graphics - enemies, items, quests logs.</p>
