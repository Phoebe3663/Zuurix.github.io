<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hello!</p>

<p>I am Ivar, also known as an independent game developer Zuurix.</p>

<p>Making games is everything to me and my ultimate goal is to become one of the best indie game developers in the world.</p>

<p>Video games have always excited me, I remember pretending to be a game developer ever since I got access to a computer.</p>
<p>I used MS Paint to make interfaces for the games I pretended to be making.</p>

<p>In 2012 my favorite game RuneScape have gone through heavy changes that made it unplayable for me.</p>
<p>The fall of RuneScape has left a huge void in my life and because I was unable to find a replacement for that game, I decided to start making my own games.</p>

<p>I learned programming basics with help of online courses and in September 2013 started making games with GameMaker: Studio.</p>

<p>In May 2016 I have released my first game on Steam.</p>

<p>I am planning to release more games in 2018, 2019, and 2020.</p>

<p>I have some programming and design experience, I can create a full game with GameMaker: Studio.</p>

<p>The only things that I truly can't do are sounds and music.</p>

<p>When I don't make games, I play games.</p>
<p>I'm also sci-fi/fantasy book and movie enthusiast.</p>

<p>End of description.</p>
