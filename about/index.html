<h1>About</h1>
	
<p>Hello!</p>
	
<p>I am Aivaras Klimas, also known as an independent game developer Zuurix.</p>

<p>I have started making games in September 2013 using GameMaker: Studio.</p>

<p>My first serious commercial game – Sector Six – was released on May 2016 as a Steam Early Access title.</p>
<p>In September 2018 it has left Early Access and currently, Sector Six is my biggest game.</p>

<p>I am planning to release more games in 2019 and 2020.</p>
