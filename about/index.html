<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HkVAOp9.jpg" style="height: 256px; width: auto; float: left; margin: 20px 20px 20px 0;">

<p>I am Aivaras Klimas a.k.a. Zuurix, an indie game developer from Lithuania.</p>
	
<p>I enjoy making games with role-playing game elements: Leveling and item systems, character customization.</p>
	
<p>In September 2013 I have completed several online JavaScript lessons, downloaded GameMaker engine and month later I had my first real game done.</p>

<p>After that I've been making games nonstop.</p>
	
<p>My first serious commercial game – Sector Six – was released on May 2016 as a Steam Early Access title.</p>
<p>In September 2018 it has left Early Access and currently, Sector Six is my most successful game.</p>

<p>Right now I am working on Light of the Locked World - a fantasy role-playing game about a developing world of Kayos.</p>
