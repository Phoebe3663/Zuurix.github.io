<h1>About</h1>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HkVAOp9.jpg" title=""/>

<p>I am Aivaras Klimas a.k.a. Zuurix, an indie game developer from Lithuania.</p>
	
<p>I love developing games with procedural generation, character customization, and world-building - looters, role-playing games, card games.</p>
	
<p>In September 2013 I have completed several online JavaScript lessons, downloaded GameMaker engine and month later I had my first real game done.</p>

<p>After that I've been making games nonstop.</p>
	
<p>My first serious commercial game – Sector Six – was released on May 2016 as a Steam Early Access title.</p>
<p>In September 2018 it has left Early Access and currently, Sector Six is my most successful game.</p>

<p>Right now I am working on Light of the Locked World - a role-playing game.</p>
