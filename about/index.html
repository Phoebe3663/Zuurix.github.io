<h1>About</h1>
	
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I am Aivaras Klimas a.k.a. Zuurix, an indie game developer.</p>

<p>I was introduced to video games when I was 10 years old and since then I am extremely passionate about them.</p>
<p>I played them, I made sketches of them, I learned about them, and ended up developing them =]</p>

<p>In September 2013 I have completed several online JavaScript lessons, downloaded GameMaker engine and month later I had my first real game done.</p>

<p>After that I've been making games nonstop.</p>
	
<p>My first serious commercial game – Sector Six – was released on May 2016 as a Steam Early Access title.</p>
<p>In September 2018 it has left Early Access and currently, Sector Six is my most successful game.</p>

<p>Right now I am working on Light of the Locked World - an RPG inspired by old school MMOs like Ultima Online and RuneScape.</p>
