<a>Full game description</a>
</comments>

<p>Legion of Eternity is a card game with deep customization, procedurally generated loot, and a story of cosmic horror.
After humanity falls to a disaster of an unknown origin, a horde of mutants and machines is sent to wake the only thing that could save what remains.</p>

<i><p>We did a horrible mistake. Before it all, the Universe used to lie on the edge of an infinitely grander existence.</p>

<p>It's a scape so alien that we couldn't comprehend it was there, even though we lived for aeons right next to it.</p>

<p>Now we know, of course, because now we're in it. We have pushed our reality into that abyss.</p>

<p>And the worst part is that we have began to adapt. Now we understand the things we shouldn't, we are no longer human.</p>

<p>Our time is limited. I need to find a solution while I still can.</p>

<p>I remember something about what I did. There is something that lurks here, a massive presence.</p>

<p>I have created you to reach out to it. To activate the remnants of greatness.</p>

<p>To do one last thing before we become infinite.</p>
	
<p>They have to know.</p></i>
