It's time for me to end Sector Six content development.

For the last several months I've been switching between working on Sector Six and Light of the Locked World.
I love both of the games, but I want to dedicate all of my time to LOTLW, and I can't do much to Sector Six to make it better.

What I can do, I'll try to do with the final update.

This is what it will contain:

**Item sorting:**

The most wanted Sector Six feature!
It will make it possible to sort items by grade, type, properties, etc. - every option that works with the current filtering system will work with item sorting.

**Final Ascension:**

Final Ascension will be an endgame activity that gives maxed players something to work on. Experience received after reaching level 90 will be used to increase the Ascension level.
Increasing Ascension level will reward players with random skins from new skin set.
Ascension level will also be a requirement to install altered parts.

**Altered parts:**

Altered parts will let me add meaningful, scaling item rewards and level 90+ parts without having to increase the level cap.

After the update, all parts will receive a chance to become altered as they are generated.

This is how it will work:

1. Part is generated.

2. The code is run to check if the part should be altered or not.

3. If it is, it gains 1 alteration level.

4. The code is run to check if the part should be altered further.

5. If it is, the alteration level increases by 1.

Step 4 and 5 are repeated until one of the checks fail.

It means that high alteration level parts will be much rarer than lower alteration level parts.

Alteration level will improve part's properties.

For example, currently, the code sets part's maximum armor property like this:

*Increases maximum armor by (part level * 250).*

After the update it will work like this:

*Increases maximum armor by ((part level + alteration level) * 250).*

Altered parts will also receive additional property.

High-level altered parts will require Ascension level to be installed.
E.g.: Level 90, alteration level 9 part will require Ascension level 9 to be installed.

**Altered instances:**

You will be able to spend alloy to make Broken Infinity instances as hard as Absolute Deterioration. Altered instances will have an increased chance to get altered parts.

**The Signal:**

Reach level 90 and get all achievements to unlock the introduction to Sector Six's sequel, Sector Zero.

**Many fixes and changes:**

Like with every update, the game will receive a lot of improvements - including increased mission failing time, new part highlighting, evolution mechanic improvements, and old glitch fixes.
I intend to end Sector Six development with 0 known glitches remaining.

In conclusion, this will be a big update!

To clarify, this is the end of new content and reworks development only - support updates to fix glitches will continue.

Hope all looks good, until next time!
