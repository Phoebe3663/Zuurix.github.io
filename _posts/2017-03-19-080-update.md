Sector Six has been updated!
This update adds a lot of new content and improves various parts of the game.

**Five new abilities!**

Era's End, apocalypse class ability: The most powerful damage dealing ability in Sector Six!

Overload, apocalypse class ability: Overload removes armour and in exchange sets all ability cooldowns to 0.

Nine Bladed Mines, carrier class ability: Releases nine bladed mines, that deal damage and remove shields.

Attract Mines, carrier class ability: Attracts mines that appear above, bellow and behind enemies and deal damage when detonated.

EMP Grenade, carrier class ability: Launches grenade that explodes and jams enemies! Jammed enemies cannot move or attack.

**Three new enemies!**

Collectors: Large, powerful enemies with unique attack abilities. Destroy collector's emitters to prevent them from using their most powerful attack.

Mosaics: Medium sized enemies that are composed of fragile parts. Mosaics launch mines that are difficult to dodge.

Drones: Small enemies similar to demolishers.

**New game+**

If you have completed all story missions, you can now go to settings and reset them.
This allows you do them all over again!
