title: "Echo #63: Secure regions and alloy container rework"
date: 2017-02-13
---

In my previous echo, that I have posted two weeks ago, I've said that I'll be working on alloy containers and secure regions.
And I did that.

Alloy containers are finally the best way to repair armour!
Each charge in alloy container now repairs 1% armour instead of just 1 armour.

Container refilling cost is now based on how much alloy is in alloy container.
That means you can refill containers that are not empty and not lose any alloy!

I have also added a bunch of new container properties and flaws:

* Filled: Containers with "Filled" are found containing the maximum amount of alloy.

* Generates x armour on kill: Amount of armour repaired on kill is based on container level.

* Eternal: Containers with "Eternal" are indestructible and gain 50 alloy if you fail the mission.

* Ancient: Containers with "Ancient" gain 30 alloy when you pass dust cloud.

* Sacrificial: Containers with "Sacrificial" destroy themselves and restores armour to 50% if armour drops to 0.

* Corrupted: Containers with "Corrupted" give no alloy when dismantled.

* Transient: Containers with "Transient" are destroyed when you complete mission.

* Unstable: Containers with "Unstable" burn alloy when you use repairing abilities.

* Gains 65 alloy every 50 kills.

* Generates 1 ether on kill.

* Gains 10 alloy every 15 kills.

* Cannot be refilled.

Small changes related to alloy containers:

* There are 5 new achievements for triggering unstable, transient, eternal, ancient and sacrificial alloy container abilities.

* I have added three new container skins.

* Item dismantling value is no longer based on item level.

* Amplifiers now give alloy when dismantled.

* Upgrading part now increases its dismantling value.

* Alloy container dismantling value is now based on the amount of the alloy in the container.

After reworking alloy containers, I have been decorating secure regions.
Because there are so many regions, I am going to leave most of the regions for future.

Next week I am going to make few last improvements and get ready for an update, that I am hoping to release next weekend!

Now I want to apologize for not posting for a while.
I couldn't post because I didn't have the internet for a few days.

If this will happen again in future, know that even if I don't post echoes, it doesn't mean I'm not working on Sector Six.
I am working always, every day =]

Until next time!
