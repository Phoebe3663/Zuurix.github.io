I'm getting close to finishing Sector Six graphics!
This week I have improved loot box, level up screen and added a box that shows difficulty rewards.
I've wanted to make these changes for a long time.

Besides that, I have added the last achievement, made icons for Steam achievements and now Sector Six is ready for the achievement update!

I have also tried making changes to the art style.
I couldn't make it work, so I decided to revert all the changes.

Next week I will be dealing with last graphical changes I want to make - some sort of movement animations, background spaceships, inventory animations.

I am also hoping to finally update the game in a few days, so keep an eye on new posts about that!

Until next time!
