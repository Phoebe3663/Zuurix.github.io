The Cursed Legion has been updated!

Several players have reported that the game is confusing because the tutorial is not doing a very good job explaining how the game works.

This update fixes that!

Now before starting combat before the first quest players will see in-depth explanations about how the card combat works.

The best part - it is possible to bring back the explanations whenever you need a reminder!

The next update will improve card combat to be more interesting! There will be new action cards, new tactical card skills, and more challenging quests!

Until next time!
