As promised, this entry is about the game's lore.

Now, the full lore is a dozen pages long, so for this entry, I'll only share the timeline of the Locked World's history.

The world's map is at the end of the post.

So, here it is:

**Year 0:**

Council of Worlds order to build the World Gate that connects Kayos, now known as the Locked World, to the World Network.

- There are a lot of terms included the timeline, I'll try to briefly explain most of them.
- The Council controls the World Gates, which connects a few dozen worlds to the Network.
- The Council's main functions are to maintain peace between worlds and to expand the Network by building new gates.

**Year 3:**

Council of Worlds order to sink a collection of confiscated magical weapons in Abyssal Waters.

- Abyssal Waters is a large and very deep body of water.
- Only 20% of the world's surface is covered by water, and Abyssal Waters does most of it.

**Year 84:**

Abysts are discovered by mages who were sent by the Council to check on the sunken weapons. Abyst Rush begins.
Gate City begins to grow near the World Gate.

- Abysts are unique crystals that form at the bottom of Abyssal Waters.
- These crystals amplify magic, they are extremely useful for hundreds of applications.

**Year 95-106:**

Demon Moon is being built.

**Year 106:**

Demon Moon was risen, the demon population shrinks rapidly from this point as they are banished to the Moon.

- Kayos is infested by demons.
- These strange, aggressive, and mindless beings are unkillable, the only way to get rid of them is to banish them where they can't do harm.

**Year 130:**

- Rezelot is the side of the World that is under the Golden Sun, inhabited by human races. It's where the game takes place.
- The other side of the world is called Erquaria - it is under the Violet Sun. The game might be expanded to include it.
