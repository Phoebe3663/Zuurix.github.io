title: "Sector Six: Update! XP and experience changes, fixes + new content!"
date: 2018-10-20

Save system status:

This update should fix the last problem with the save system, hopefully, save files will no longer get corrupted.
If you're still having problems - report them immediately.
I also recommend backing up save files just in case - don't forget that Sector Six save file folders get synced and backups get erased in they are stored there.
Note: Because of a mistake, save files made in version 1.0.2 cause crash.
