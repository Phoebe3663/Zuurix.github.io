The Cursed Legion now has a better battle engine!
Now it's more consistent and produces less unwanted events.

Another big change is new card skills and stats!
About a half of cards have been reworked to have new skill skills that do not target random enemies.

* Laser X: Deals X damage to the last unit in the enemy row.
* Smite X: Deals X damage to the enemy unit that is next to commander.
* Beacon X: Restores X health to itself and nearby units.
* Suppress X: Temporarily reduces the attack of three enemies in front by X.
* Siphon: Enemy cannot play action cards.

With new skills comes new animations - most of the skills now have better animations.
I have also added a minor death animation.

Finally, I have added 10 new cards!

* Martyr Queen Celsia - Uncommon Rebellion Commander.
* Firehaul Supreme - Common Rebellion Unit.
* Abandoned Warehouse - Uncommon Swarm Structure.
* Pantheon of Void - Rare Legion Structure.
* Aspect of Void - Rare Legion Unit.
* Scytheous - Uncommon Corporation Unit.
* Deathray - Uncommon Corporation Action.
* Lord of Eruption - Uncommon Legion Unit.
* Shagor's Fire - Uncommon Legion Action.
* Rumbling Megacraft - Common Alliance Unit.

This update has changed the game quite a bit, so feedback on changes would be very appreciated!

Have fun!
