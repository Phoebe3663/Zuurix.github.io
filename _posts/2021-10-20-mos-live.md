That's right, this is the big secret project I've been hinting at!

I've been working on Magic of Spring with extremely skilled Minho Kim and Bert Cole.

Bert Cole composed the music for Sector Six and Light of the Locked World, so you know he's good =]

Minho Kim is the artist of Devespresso Games, the team that created the great-looking Coma games, Vambrace: Cold Soul, Scarlet Hood and the Wicked Wood.

Now that the Steam page is live, we will focus on creating an enjoyable alpha demo, we hope it will be ready to play next month.

So, that's all for now, until next time!
