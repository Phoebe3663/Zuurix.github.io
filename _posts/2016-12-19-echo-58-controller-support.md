title: "Echo #58: Controller support"

This week I have begun working on controller support!

Going pretty well so far, although Sector Six is not a very good game for a controller. It uses so many buttons!

Now it's possible to do these things with a controller:

* Browse and interact with most of the game's interfaces.

* Move, activate abilities from 1 to 8 and use alloy container during combat.

What still needs to be made possible: 

* Inventory and alloy container management.

* Spaceship building.

* Pause, mission end and level up interface browsing.

* Using 9th ability.

When that is done, I will only need to update the tutorial to explain controls with a controller.

This won't take long, so I am planning to also fix several annoying glitches before updating the game.

That's all for this echo.
I will post again soon, so until then!
