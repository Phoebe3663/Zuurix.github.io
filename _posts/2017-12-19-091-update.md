This update adds two new story missions!

Fight new minions and bosses, meet a new character, endure despair and end the first chapter of the story!

From here the story will get even darker.

Other changes:

* Fixed: It was possible to reflect apex's red lasers.
* Fixed: Dozan Vel area glitch.
* Fixed: "You can use more weapons" message used to appear on level up screen even after maxing out weapon limit.
* Fixed: City trade link was above item tooltips.
* Siege missions now take less time to complete.
* Replaced "Cannot be refilled" alloy container flaw with "Loses 20 alloy after every mission".
* Added backgrounds for Silaar, Charred Link, Nebula, Rift and Broken Infinity.
* Improved backgrounds.
* Removed fog.
