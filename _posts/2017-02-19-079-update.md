Secure regions can now be entered!
Complete the missions to make regions secure, then enter them and get in the cities to buy and sell items!

There are:

* Cities that sell generic weapons.

* Cities that sell random parts.

* Cities that sell high-grade parts.

* Cities that sell alloy containers.

* Cities that sell extant parts.

* Cities that sell amplifiers.

* Cities that sell random grade parts and amplifiers.

Almost every region has a city.
You will have to secure multiple regions to get access to all types of cities.

Another big change of this update is the new alloy containers!

* Changed the way alloy containers repair armour, now each container charge repairs 1% armour.

* Container refill cost is now based on alloy in the container.

* Rebalanced amount of alloy received when dismantling items.

* New container property: Filled.

* New container property: Gains 65 alloy every 50 kills.

* New container property: Generates 1 ether on kill.

* New container property: Generates armour on kill.

* New container property: Gains 10 alloy every 15 kills.

* New container property: Eternal.

* New container property: Ancient.

* New container property: Sacrificial.

* New container flaw: Corrupted.

* New container flaw: Cannot be refilled.

* New container flaw: Transient.

* New container flaw: Unstable.

* Removed property: Gains charges on kill.

* Removed property: Reduced refill cost.

* Removed flaw: Increased refill cost.

* Added 3 new container skins.

* Now it's possible to swap alloy containers.

Other changes:

* Upgraded parts now have a higher value.

* Added 5 achievements for triggering new container abilities.

* Improved amplifier sprites.

* Amplifiers now amplify part properties based on amplified part level, not on amplifier level.

* You can no longer apply Almadi cathodes and anodes to parts attached to your spaceship.

* Applying cathodes and anodes no longer erase their names.

* Alpha Pulsar region renamed to Bloom.

* Beta Pulsar region renamed to Pulsar Vector.

* Added HUD hiding.

* Improved item tooltip placement.

* Recolored few regions.

* Shielding abilities now share cooldowns.

* Fixed apparition and seeking projectile glitch.

* Dock part now looks better.

* Story mission V will now take less time to complete.

* Now it's possible to dismantle (and sell items) by pressing X button on the controller.

Because this is a big update, keep an eye on glitches or balance flaws!

Have fun!
