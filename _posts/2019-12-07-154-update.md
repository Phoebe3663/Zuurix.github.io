Better endgame, better relics, Belarusian translation, and more!

**Endgame changes:**

* Decayed fragments required to create deterioration relics: Reduced from 1000 to 100. There's no reason to keep more casual players from getting Arcane Arsenal achievement. Including myself =]
* Level 30+ alloy container vendor stock: Increased from 3 alloy containers to 22. Made getting those transient containers less of a hassle.
* At max spaceship level: Altered Instance and Absolute Deterioration multipliers now also affect the experience. That means millions of Ascension XP!
* Altered part drop chance in altered instances: Increased by 20%.

**Relic rework:**

* Dismantling relics now always gives reliquary diode.
* Relic property amount: Increased from 7 to 9, one above fully upgraded etalons.
* Relics can now have scaling properties. E.g.: +x maximum armor, +x ether on kill.
* Graphically improved Upgrade Sockets, Amplifier Well.
* Tempoquake, Cryostasis now reduces weapon damage by 50%, instead of 90%.
