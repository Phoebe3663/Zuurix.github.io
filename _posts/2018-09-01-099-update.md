Everything that relates to ether has improved.

Plus, tons of improvements to all sources of rewards.

Sector Six will come out of Early Access on September 7th and I need your help to spot problems - more than ever!
I can't guarantee that there are no crashes/balancing issues left, but most of the content should work as intended.
