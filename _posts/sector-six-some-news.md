Some have things have changed. 

1)

Sector Six is no longer published by Michael Jendryssek.

Without him, Sector Six would probably not be on Steam today and I am very grateful for that - I'm sure all those players who enjoyed Sector Six can relate, so let's thank him =]

From now on everything will be managed by me, Aivaras Klimas a.k.a. Zuurix.
That is should not affect players in any way.

2)

Sector Six might get some updates.

I have decided to dedicate Saturdays to working on low priority projects - side projects and finished major projects. This includes Sector Six!

Currently, I'm busy with [Magic of Autumn](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1184450/Magic_of_Autumn/), but after some time I'll be able to start updating Sector Six.

First of all, I'm thinking about doing a small relic rework - a bunch of minor changes to making relics truly the top tier parts.

But more about that later - for now that's all the news.

Until next time!
