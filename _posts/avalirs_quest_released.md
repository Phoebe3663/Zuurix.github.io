Avalir’s Quest is a game I made while working on Sector Six.

[Get from GameJolt >>](https://gamejolt.com/games/avalirsquest/304756)

It was originally made as a birthday gift for my little brother and after it was done, I spent some more time working more on it, because my brother kept asking for more content =]

Anyway, now I’m done with it, and now it’s available, so have fun, if you can.
