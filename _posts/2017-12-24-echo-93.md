This week I've done many small things.

I have started 75% discount on Steam, updated store page, fixed several glitches, expanded mission interface for new missions and finished writing for story mission VII.

It was a busy week, but what I did is not very interesting to write about, so this post is perfect to officially reveal Sector Six sequel, ENTER and other games!

Yes, I already have plans for multiple games =]
If you have any questions about them, I ready to answer them.

Happy holidays and until next echo =]
