This demo update adds a whole new area - Eastern Trilith, tier 2 equipment for all classes, combat visual improvements, dozens of small additions, and bug fixes.
I've done a lot in these four months!

If you do end up playing the demo, please share your thoughts about the direction the game is going, report bugs, etc.

The feedback is - as always - very important.

The information about what's in the next update is coming with LOTLW Devblog #24.

Have fun =]
