Here are my plans for the end of Early Access, pre-release beta, and post-release updates:

**Release preparations**

Testing, uploading new achievements, etc.

**Pre-release beta**

*IMPORTANT: Saves will not be erased after pre-release beta.*

*IMPORTANT: In pre-release beta, the game is essentially complete. The beta is just in case, I expect Sector Six to be without any major flaws at this point.*

During the beta, I'll ask everyone to play the game to find as many problems as possible!
There's a lot of new features and it's too much for me to test on my own.
During this period I'll also be making a new, final Sector Six trailer and updating the store page.

**End of Early Access**

The big release!

**Post-release**

During September, I'll be releasing updates to fix glitches and balance things, if needed.
After September, I'll either start working on a new game or continue developing Sector Six.
This depends on the number of sales.

If the game will sell much more copies than it sells now, on average, I'll continue working on Sector Six.
I doubt that it will happen, but it's not impossible.

If the game will not sell much more than during Early Access, I'll move on to the next game. I'll still update Sector Six annually to add the content that is currently missing.

**Perfection Project updates**

If the game will sell enough copies, some or most of this will be implemented:

- Full scaling support
- Maze mission
- Boss craft mission
- Boss siege mission
- Tomb capture mission
- Tomb purge mission
- Perfected time attack mission
- Perfected arena mission
- Two more bosses for boss missions.
- Improved armored colony seeker.
- Improved mission entering and leaving times.
- Massive parts.
- Intellect Encryption Template activity.
- Lost Regions activity.
- Level 30-90 content.
- Full background overhaul.
- New modes.
- New enemies and ruins.
- 100+ relics.

**Minimum Project updates**

Otherwise, only this will be implemented:

- Tomb capture mission
- Tomb purge mission
- Perfected time attack mission
- Perfected arena mission
- Two more bosses for boss missions.
- Improved armored colony seeker.
- Improved mission entering and leaving times.
- 30+ relics.

*IMPORTANT: Everything between minimum and perfection is possible =]*

Like always, I will do everything based on feedback and analysis, so these lists will probably change.

**Prepare for the beta!**
