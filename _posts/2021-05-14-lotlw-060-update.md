Hey all,

I've just updated a demo with a bunch of minor changes.

For those who might have saves made in the previous demo version: Please start a new save.
The old one will probably immediately crash because of engine changes in the new version.

Have fun and see you all in July when LOTLW might have a big beta test =]
