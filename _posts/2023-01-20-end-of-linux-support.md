Hey Linux users,

Unfortunately, due to a lack of resources, I will no longer be updating the Linux version of the game.

If it's any consolation, the game appears to be working properly via Steam's Proton:

**Library > Sector Six > Properties > Compatibility > Enable: Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool > Select: Proton Next**

(The game doesn't work via Proton Experimental - other versions of Proton are untested)

The non-latest Linux version of the game will remain untouched.

I was unable to verify that it works properly, so I will be de-listing Sector Six as a game with a Linux version.

I always wanted to have Linux versions of the game, but that has become too difficult for me.

Thanks for playing!
