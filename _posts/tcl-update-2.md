**Action cards**

Actions are the new type of cards. Instead of creating minions, action cards activate powerful skills
 This adds a whole new layer of strategy!

**Iriary**

The Republic of Iriary is a new area east of Columa. 
Iriary contains 10 new challenging quests with generous rewards.

**Starter cards**

Instead of spending 100 silver to buy 6 random cards in the beginning, now you choose one of 5 starter packs.
In addition to 4 cards of the chosen faction, you will also receive 2 action cards.

**New cards**

Over 10 new cards have been added to Rebirth recruitment pack and Iriary quest rewards!

**Target skills**

Several of newly added cards have Strike Target skill.
Strike Target will deal damage to a card selected by you!

**Minor improvements**

* Slightly improved map interface.
* Silver Knight now has Boost All Corporation 1 on Play instead of Boost All Corporation 1.
* Moth Swarm now costs 2 influence, has 0 attack and 3 health.
* Mobile Blockade now has Instant instead of Summon Mobile Blockade on Death.
* Giant Spider is now uncommon and it has 8 health instead of 10.
* Cursed Scout now has 1 health instead of 2 and 1 attack instead of 2.
* Locust Prince now has Void 1.
* Improved card and skill name resizing.
* Added action cards.
* Rebalanced replay rewards.
* Quest rewards are now included in quest description.
* Improved Barracks quest.
* Changed Overwhelm skill.

**What's next?**

This update is a huge step forward, but The Cursed Legion is still full of problems!
Next update will improve the battle system - many annoying inconsistencies and glitches will be fixed.
I will also try to implement card redraw feature.
But more about that in upcoming posts!

**Have fun!**
