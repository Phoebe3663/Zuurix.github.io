Sector Six story is completed!

I admit that I wanted too much from it.
14 different missions, 8 bosses, choices, all those dialogues - it was too much for me to do it flawlessly.

But the most important thing for me was to make a story campaign that is more than just...
More than just a bunch of "go there" goals so that player would know what to do.

So I think I have accomplished that and I'm happy.

Other cool things that I did:

The story is now literally bigger because I increased dialogue font size!

Loot box now shows up to 170 items!

I have updated boss missions to use all minions, instead of just scions, sentinels, and gatherers.
It also supports Manifestations of Destruction and doesn't support The Decision modifiers now, so it's, well, better.

I have added more bulwark blocks for siege missions, now there are explosive blocks that destroy blocks diagonally when hit and blocks that contain loot!

Finally, the arena missions have been improved significantly.
Now they support The Assault of the Modified and The Rain of Fire modifiers, and you no longer need to keep going back to summon new minions.

And now I'm going to work on endgame content!

The current plan is to make the procedurally generated region with objectives and rising loot quality, war to secure all areas, new mission type, and more relics!
