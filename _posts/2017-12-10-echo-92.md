The wait is nearly over!

This week I have finished making story mission VI, with all its bosses and encounters!
Now I need to make story mission VII, but it's more a cutscene than a mission, so it won't take me longer than a day to make it.

Then there's the mandatory polishing/minor bug fixing phase and I can release the update!

This should happen this week, so keep an eye on announcements!
