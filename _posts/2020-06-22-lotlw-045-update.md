This massive update adds two new classes, new items, new abilities, new weapon types, improved combat, new introduction quest, improved animations, improved enemy AI, new rogue NPCs, and dozens of smaller changes.

As always, feedback is very important: If you got any thoughts, share them in the comments, my Twitter, or Discord.

Plans for the next demo update:

Until next time!
