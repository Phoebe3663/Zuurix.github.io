title: "Sector Six Release Countdown: 7!"

This and previous week, I've been improving Sector Six loot.

I have made many changes to random part generation system, made higher grade parts more common, added 22 part properties, gave parts more interesting names, but most importantly – I have implemented relic system and first 7 relics!

Relics not only are the rarest and the most powerful items in the game - they also have unique effects, skins, and even animations!

I would have made a video about relics, but I didn't have enough time for that, so instead scroll down for screenshots.

With relics implemented, now I will work on the last story mission and several small changes.
