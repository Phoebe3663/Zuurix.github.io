This update adds abilities and trading system: Now it's possible to buy and sell items.

**New combat**

Learn new abilities and unleash them upon your enemies!
For the combat testing purposes, iron swords and ability instructions can be found in the spawn point, so grab them, get right to the new combat, and tell me what you think!

**Trading**

No longer rely on enemy drops to equip and heal!
Head to Locul emporium and see what the merchants there have to offer.

* Improved and expanded enemy AI.
* Improved HUD and health bars.
* Improved collision checks: Fixed many problems with interacting through solid objects.
* Improved engine overall: Many new systems and scripts that will help me further develop the game.
* Added new sound effects.

**What's next**
