This week I was working on the new story mission.

I'm about 60% done, I have added all required enemies, finished writing and finished 1 out of 3 boss fights.
Mission VI is divided into three parts and at the end of each part, there's a small boss fight.
When I say small I mean that it's smaller than boss fight in mission V.

Anyway, here's havoc and scythe, the new minions:

![Havoc](https://github.com/Zuurix/Zuurix.github.io/blob/master/images/echo%2091/Havoc%202017.12.03.png?raw=true)

![Scythe](https://github.com/Zuurix/Zuurix.github.io/blob/master/images/echo%2091/Scythe%202017.12.03.png?raw=true)

Scythe is the first minion that is able to destroy player shields.
It releases slow moving bladed mines that aren't hard to dodge, but if you will activate a shield, it will be gone instantly.

Havoc does the opposite - you will have to shield yourself or you'll take massive damage!

So, that's all news for now.

Until next time!
