title: "Argentine Peso and Turkish Lira price change"

A bit ago Steam proposed new default prices in Turkish and Argentine currencies.

The games - Magic of Autumn, Sector Six - now have these prices.

The games used to cost very little when on higher discounts in these currencies so that's the main reason for this change.
I believe this was exploited in several previous sales.
