This update implements the last item and spaceship building features!

**Part sets**

Now you will have a chance to find parts that belong to a set.
If you will equip 12 parts of the same set, you will be able to activate a powerful set effect!

There are 7 part sets:

* Etherion's Clash:

*+400% damage.
Damage boost is applied only if your spaceship has equal amount of relays, pylons, and nodes.*

* Cor's Voidshape:

*Enemy projectiles go through your spaceship.
Enemy projectiles damage your spaceship only if they hit the Elder Mechanism.
Shield duration is reduced to 2 seconds.
Maximum armour is reduced by 90%.
Reflect chance is reduced to 0%.
Taken damage reduction is reduced to 0%.*

* Ultranid's Torment:

*Cooldowns of all abilities are reduced to 0.5 seconds.
Activating an ability deals damage to your spaceship.
Damage dealt is equal to 10% of maximum armour.*

* Oesa's Radiance:

*Your spaceship gets +1% damage for every 5 ether.
Base maximum armour of your spaceship is equal to maximum ether multiplied by 50.*

* Kithalia's Blight:

*Your spaceship has +4% damage for every 1% of missing ether.
Your spaceship is destroyed if ether reaches 100.*

* Azimar's Killframe:

*Weapon limit is equal to part limit.
Ether is removed.*

* Lodeon's Ultimatum:

*Relay, pylon and node damage is equal to maximum armour of your spaceship.
Every 1 seconds damage is dealt to your spaceship.
Damage dealt is equal to 2% of maximum armour.*

Only extant, mythical and etalon parts can belong to a set.
