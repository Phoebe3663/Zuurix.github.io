Hey all,

Just a small update: We're delaying the release of the game by a few months to give us more time to polish it.
The planned features turned out to take more time than planned due to the level of quality we're trying to reach, so this is necessary.

Currently, we're aiming for a release in June.

I also want to mention that the game will launch with 80 cards and 80 battles, as opposed to 100/100 - the other 20/20 are coming after the release.

Finally, there's more content in-game now - if you wish to test it, head to our [Discord server](https://zuurix.com/community/) and ask for access to the test version.
This would help us out a lot since testing is becoming difficult due to the increasing size of the game and card pool =]

That's all for now!

Happy Easter and until next time!
