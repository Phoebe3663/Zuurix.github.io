'Ello all!

My website and my Discord server have been online for a while now, but they are lacking activity.

For Discord that is because I never tried inviting anyone to join it.
For the website, well... There's no good reason to visit it =P

This changes today!

[Join my Discord server >>](https://discord.gg/rAr3Xr4)

It's the best place to get news and talk about my games.

My website from now on will have a neat little feature: Weekly messages.
It's simple: Every week I will post a new message. There will be reveals, competitions, and rewards!

I'm also planning to giveaway few copies of Sector Six in my Discord server and other places, so don't miss upcoming announcements =]
