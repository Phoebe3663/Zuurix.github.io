Last week wasn't any better than previous ones.

I was having weird post-flu paracetamol poisoning induced depression and I had to do a lot of work on the farm.
Because of that, very little progress was made with story mission X, so I don't really have anything to write about.

Instead, here are screenshots from upcoming version:
