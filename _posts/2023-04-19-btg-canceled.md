Hi all,

I have decided to no longer work on this game.
What was meant to be a small update to my older game grew to be quite an undertaking.

The game is in a playable state, but I'm just not satisfied with it - and for that to change, I would have to work longer than I can allow myself at this point.

So I had to make this decision. A little sad, but that happens, I guess.
I am planning to de-list the game soon.

Thank you for your interest!
