This is a follow-up to "LOTLW Devblog #10: History of the Locked World", this time it's more about the locations and less about the events.

The world's name is Kayos. Its title of the Locked World has two meanings: It is teleportation-locked, meaning that standard teleportation spells do not function in Kayos, and it's also tidally locked.
Tidally locked worlds do not spin around their axes, so one of the sides always faces the star. In Kayos' case, it's tidally locked between two stars.

The side that always faces the yellow giant - Dragon's Eye - is called Rezelot, and the side that always faces the purple dwarf - Erquam - is called Erquaria.

Astronomy of the Locked World?

Anyway, as I mentioned before, the game takes place in Rezelot, Erquaria will be inaccessible.

Rezelot is the land surrounding Abyssal Waters.

(The map size is 1600x1600, try viewing it in a separate tab)

**Abyssal Waters**

Abyssal Waters is an extremely deep body of water.
Abyssal Waters captures and redistributes the heat, giving the surrounding areas a gentle climate.
It's also special because crystals called abysts grow on the bottom of it.
If not abysts, Rezelot would have never been colonized.

**Two Suns Desert**

A desert east of Rezelot, that doesn't fully belong to Rezelot and Erquaria.
The middle of it is a permanent sunset zone of both Dragon's Eye and Erquam.
This where the light of both stars meets, it's the hottest region in the Kayos.

**O'ool**

A frozen wasteland west of Rezelot.
Like Two Suns Desert, it is between Rezelot and Erquaria.
The sky above O'ool is always covered by clouds of smoke from a chain of volcanoes in Erquaria, it's dark and cold here.
O'ool gives western Rezelot a cool climate.

**Pole Wastes**

Rezelot, Erquaria, Two Suns Desert, and O'ool converge in the world's pole wastes, which are lifeless gravel fields.
There are two points of interest in Rezelot that are close to the Pole Wastes - Azu'urunn and the Listening Tower.

**Pinewoods**

Impassable forests of tangled kayian pines that occupy a large part of Rezelot land between Northern Pole Waste and Abyssal Waters
These pines are the only trees that grow in Kayos.

**Moonrise Desert**

A desert in the north-eastern part of the Rezelot.
Under a thin layer of the desert's sand, there are deposits of iron-rich rocks.
This is where the iron to build an artificial moon was mined from, leaving pits that followed the rock deposits.
The moon was later launched into the orbit, giving desert its name.

**Moonrise Site**

A field in Moonrise Desert where Demon Moon was launched.

**Interference Point**

Interference is a disruption of the World Gates, which brings people from other worlds to Kayos.
Interference takes people to a spot in Moonrise Desert, south of the Locul town and that spot is called Interference Point.

**Locul**

Town in Moonrise Desert.
It used to be a miner town, now it's a small outpost of civilization in the middle of nowhere.
It has a tavern, an emporium, a lab, a small mine, two matter kilns, an immigration office, and Locul Mining Company headquarters.

**Eastern Trilith**

Eastern Trilith is on the edge between Moonrise Desert and Eir Meadows, it's the closest town to Locul.
The other and bigger half of this town is on the other side of Rezelot.
Those halves are joined together by talkstone triliths.
Eastern Trilith is a town not bigger than Locul and is mostly inhabited by soldiers who guard it.

**Eir Meadows**

West from Eastern Trilith is Eir Meadows, a land of fertile soil covered in grass.

**Canals**

Irrigation canals that take water from Abyssal Waters to the edge of Moonrise Desert, extending the Eir Meadows.

**Eir**

A small but busy farmer town. Meadows around Eir is has been turned into farmland, which feeds the city of Luma.

**Luma**

The largest and most influential city in Kayos often called the capital of the world.
If it isn't that, then it's is the capital of Rezelot.
Like all coastal cities in Kayos, Luma is an abyst city.
It means that the main function is the city to lift crystals with magic amplifying properties from the bottom of the Abyssal Waters.
This difficult work is done in the mining docks, that extend far into the Abyssal Waters.
The dirty and noisy port area is surrounded by tall, beautiful houses, mansions, and towers - Luma is a densely populated and rich city.

**Smuggler's Hat**

An island that looks vaguely like a sailor's hat when viewed from one of its sides.

**Kingdom's End**

North of Luma is a battlefield in which Luma's and Berelem's armies defeated armies of the Kingdom, ending the coastal city rebellion against the Azu'urunn monarch tyranny.
It's a land ravaged by magic, covered in remains of war equipment, and haunted by possessed armor, the Kingdom's artificial, demonic soldiers.

**Atan's Enclave**

**Iron Stronghold**

A fortification north of Luma, a defense line between pinewoods, between the Kingdom and Luma.
If not its iron walls, Luma could have been taken over by the Kingdom, putting an end to the rebellion.
It was under siege almost all seven of the War's years, but with support from all of the rebel cities, it did not fell.

**Salt Road**

A trade route for goods - mostly salt - from Erquarian Station, though most of the goods reach the rest of Rezelot via boats from Berelem.
Salt is nowhere to be found in Rezelot, so it has to be imported from Erquaria.

**Edario's Island**

An island created by Edario, a powerful mage of Berelem.
Bridges to the island were destroyed by Edario to trap the Kingdom's army who marched through the Island to attack Berelem.

**Erquarian Station**

The only place in Kayos where you will meet erquarians, the non-human people from the land under the purple sun.

**Thousand Towers**

An industrial city south of Western Trilith.
Its name comes from hundreds of abyst towers - contraptions that are used in the creation of amalgam - light, strong, and spell amplifying metal made by fusing abyst dust, silver, and gold.

**Glowing Village**

The abysts have a dangerous property - if there are a lot of them in one place, they start glowing and emitting magical waves that damage the minds of people in the vicinity.
They never stop glowing, this village is one of the places in Rezelot that were abandoned because of this effect.

**Spirit Pastures**

**Branna's Hill**

**Velt**

Abandoned fishing village, where ships take mages to and back from the Listening Tower.

If I haven't missed anything, that should be all of the places on the map.

I hope it was an interesting read, and I'm cutting this entry right here, as I already spend a lot of writing it.

Until next time =]
