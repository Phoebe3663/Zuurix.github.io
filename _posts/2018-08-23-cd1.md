title: "Sector Six Release Countdown: 1!"

About 3 years and 8 months ago, I have started working on Sector Six. And now it's finished.

When I started working on Sector Six, I thought that I'll complete it in 3 months. It was supposed to be a small sequel to Sector Seven. I wanted to make it just because I promised I'll have a sequel to Sector Seven.

It was 2015 January or February when I have released an alpha version of Sector Six.
I didn't expect anything and I was surprised to get positive feedback.

It was enough for me to thinking about making Sector Six into a bigger game than I initially planned.

I said to myself: "People like this, and I can do much better so why not do it?"
So I started working harder.

Hundreds of times I decided to rework something because it wasn't as good as I could do, and I'm very glad I did.

Sector Six is not perfect, but it is about 10 times better than I imagined it in the beginning.
And it is like that because of feedback. Every "Great game, but X could be better" made Sector Six better.

I always wanted to be a game developer and make games like Sector Six and I'm incredibly happy and grateful that it happened.

I hope that this is not the end of Sector Six. I hope I'll be able to continue working on it and make it even better.

Sector Six was finished on 21st August. 22nd August was a bad day - I had problems with a monitor, so I had to spend an entire day fixing them.

This day I was testing Sector Six. I have already spent like 8 hours testing the game, and I have only completed half of the story.

Tomorrow I hope to finish testing and with luck, Sector Six version 0.9.9 will become available for everyone to play in the weekend.
