New card has been added and revealed on my Patreon page! [Click here to to Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/zuurix)

Haven't posted anything about the Cursed Legion for a while!
The reason is that I was simply working a lot on Sector Six and I didn't have enough time to work on the Cursed Legion.

I did few pretty cool things through.
I've made new animations for Restore, Boost, Block and Break skills, got rid of the most random target skills and added new epic battle music!

I can't tell when the Cursed Legion will be updated next, but probably soon.
