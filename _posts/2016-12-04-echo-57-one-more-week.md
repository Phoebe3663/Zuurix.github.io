title: "Echo #57: One more week"

Okay guys, I know game was not updated for longer than month, but give me one more week!

All this time since the last echo I was working on [classified].
Right now it's almost done, but I need to add 8 more [classified] until it's finished.

Like I said before, no spoilers.

When [classified] will be finished, polishing phase will begin.

New item management buttons and new enemy grouping has few problems that I have to fix before releasing game.

Besides that, with the mission V comes two changes to Sector Six missions.

You will no longer be able to enter the Core region, only during mission IV, future story missions and endgame.
You will also no longer be able to do resurrection missions without [classified], that can be obtained during mission V.

These changes are necessary for story to make sense.
They should not affect gameplay much.

I should manage to do all this new week and update game on weekend.

Wish me luck!
