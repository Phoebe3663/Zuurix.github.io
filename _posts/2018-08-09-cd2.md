Sector Six endgame content batch 1 is done!

I have added three endgame activities:

**Infinity Instances**
Complete areas in procedurally generated regions that are in Broken Infinity to gain loot quality bonus.
Includes instance boss missions and increased chance of spawning uncommon mission types.

**Restoration War**
In the endgame, random regions get scaled to your level, so you can complete missions in low-level regions and secure areas you haven't secured yet.
Securing all 144 areas in Sector Six will reward you with a very powerful relic.

**Arcane Arsenal**
Obtain all relics in the game to get a special relic that will appear in all your saves.

If there will be a demand for more content, I'll add more endgame activities.

Now I will be working on new achievements, the new save system, a few minor things and...

Well, that is all!

The new ETA is 13 days.
I have added extra few days to ETA just in case =]

Normally I'd put task list and screenshots here, but that takes a lot of time and soon it will be possible to experience changes directly, so I won't bother this time =]

I am going to make another post about my plans for the future of Sector Six, pre-release beta, and out of Early Access release, so until then!
