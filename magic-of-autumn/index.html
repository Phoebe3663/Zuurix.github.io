<a>About the game</a>
</comments>

<p>Magic of Autumn is a singleplayer CCG with an overworld - and everything in the overworld can be turned into a card.</p>
	
<p><b>Story</b></p>
	
<p>You were the Imperial Warden, the most powerful conjurer of the Eight Kingdoms.
Your soul was stolen. You must get it back.</p>
	
<p><b>Conjuring</b></p>

<p>The only power that the soulless ones can wield.
Everything in the physical plane can be conjured into idols and wishes that become your guardians and weapons during fights in the Spirit World.</p>
	
<p><b>Combat</b></p>

<p>In the physical plane, you are just a faint shadow. You can you only attack in the Spirit World.
The combat system is inspired by games like Hearthstone and Magic: The Gathering.
It's easy to learn for those who are not familiar with the genre and it has rule twists to make it interesting for the veterans.</p>

<p><b>Exploration</b></p>
	
<p>Explore a remote Golden Apple Island, a place haunted by seasonal spirits, and protected by runes designed to stop you.
You come here at autumn, hoping that the defenses would be weakened during the season of decay.
Win fights to break runes and gain access the new areas of the Island that is full of things to find.</p>
